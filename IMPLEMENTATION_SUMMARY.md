- **Glass morphism effects** with backdrop blur on header

### 🧭 Navigation Header
- **Modified PayloadCMS Header** instead of creating new floating header
- **Fixed position** with backdrop blur effect
- **Navigation items**: About Me, Projects, Blog, Notes, Contact Me (CTA)
- **Mobile responsive** with hamburger menu
- **Active section detection** with smooth scrolling
- **Your logo/brand**: "rssmv." in the top left
